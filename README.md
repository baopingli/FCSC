This code implements the algorithm by Bristow et al. in their CVPR 2013 paper titled: "Fast Convolutional Sparse Coding". We have a tech report that corrects a number of errors in the original paper and discuss implementation details of the algorithm. This report can be found <a href="http://baileykong.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/techreport.pdf">here</a>.

If you use this code in a publication, we would be grateful if you cite:
